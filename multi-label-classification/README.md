# Multi Label Classification of Image Data

In this project we develop a model to classify a modified MNIST dataset available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LcKqf1d7bctw5lx0YZf31kCUF0zEYOsi/view

Each image contains anywhere from 1-5 digits, the task is to develop a model capable of labelling all 5. Our group chose to adopt an approach where we use 
computer vision methods to segment the digits from the image and label them individually. To run simply place the MNIST_synthetic.zip file in the same directory as the code.
